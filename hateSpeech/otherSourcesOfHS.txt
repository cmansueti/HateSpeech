George von Schoenerer (1824-1921) was the mouthpiece of 
a pan-Germanistic hatred of the Jews which found expression 
in violent speeches. The beer hall was a favorite Schoenerer 
assembly room. But though his diction was crude, his followers 
were recruited from the upper middle classes and blended hatred 
of the Habsburgs and the Catholic Church with anti-Semitism. 
Nevertheless he had not a few sympathizers even among the 
clergy. Funds to support the movement were supplied by 
extremist Protestant groups in Germany, and Schoenerer him- 
self became a Protestant in a wave of secession from the 
Catholic Church that was the greatest Austria had known since 
the Reformation. The principal tenet of his political doctrine 
was that the Jews had undermined the national economy and 
therewith created the social problem, which in turn was costing 
much money. Close to Schoenerer was the Ostara group, the 
publication sponsored by whom is an important source of more 
modern anti-Semitic propaganda.
